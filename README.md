dotfiles
========

Common dot files I use, with extensive customization for OSX

```
     $ git clone git://github.com/andsens/homeshick.git ${HOME}/.homesick/repos/homeshick
     $ ${HOME}/.homesick/repos/homeshick/bin/homeshick clone git@github.com:niall-byrne/dotfiles.git
```

Please note the 'lockscreen' binary, is for OSX only.
