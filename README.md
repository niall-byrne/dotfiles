dotfiles
========

Common Dotfiles I use, with extensive customization for OSX

```
     $ git clone git://github.com/andsens/homeshick.git ${HOME}/.homesick/repos/homeshick
     $ ${HOME}/.homesick/repos/homeshick/bin/homeshick clone https://github.com/niall-byrne/dotfiles-osx.git
```

Please note the 'lockscreen' binary, is for osx only.
